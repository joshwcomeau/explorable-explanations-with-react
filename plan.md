Intro
1) Title card
2) Intro - name, job
3) … And I really like building stuff on the side
4) Quick demo of Tello
5) Quick demo of Guppy
6) Demo of Waveforms
7) One of my most satisfying side-projects ever
8) [Snippet of email 1]
9) [Snippet of email 2]
10) This project was meaningful to people because it allowed them to learn in a way that videos or articles don’t. Being able to play with the model is a way to supercharge intuitive understanding
11) There’s a whole community of people doing this stuff! explorabl.es
12) Demo of “To Build A Better Ballot”
13) React might be the perfect tool to build these kinds of things
14) Going back to waveforms demo. Notice how the waveform on the left changes several times throughout the experience.
15) React was built to solve these kinds of problems. Working on them makes you a better React developer
16) Today we’re gonna recreate this explorable explanation

Main Presentation
1) A simple waveform on the screen
2) First question I had to answer was… “How do I draw this?”
3) Canvas vs SVG
4) Getting the path data - considered curves, but it seemed too complicated with animation, so I opted to cheat, and just draw a bunch of straight lines, 1px apart
