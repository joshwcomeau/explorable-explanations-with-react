            I usually have a side project going, and earlier this year I wanted
            to try something different. Before I got into programming, I was
            an audio engineer. I've always been fascinated by how
            sound works, the physics of sound are really interesting. And yet,
            it's not common knowledge, it's institutional knowledge for audio
            engineers and other folks who work with sound.

            I think the reason for that is that it's not easily transmitted
            knowledge

            For example, when you search for this stuff on Google, you get
            articles like this. I don't want to denigrate this page, or others
            like it, because the authors clearly put a lot of time and care
            into creating something helpful, but it's a tall order for someone
            without an audio background to be presented with words and pictures,
            and to come away with a working intuitive knowledge for complex
            systems.

            There's a couple things that make this tough.




            Something interesting I heard a while ago is that language is lossy.
            I have a body of working knowledge in my head, and I can try and
            transmit that body of working knowledge to others, through words
            and drawings, but

            The first is that language is lossy.

            Words are a way to try and transmit an idea from my head to yours,
            but at best they're a rough approximation. Complex systems aren't
            easily compressed into a handful of vocal bits, it would take hours
            of talking just to go over all the rules of a system.

            And, it still wouldn't be sufficient, because...

            The best way to do that is through experimentation.

            Our brains are really good at building intuition through
            experimentation. We all understand how gravity works because we can
            toss things in the air and see how they react. When you think about
            it, basketball players are amazing, because it demonstrates such
            deep understanding of how gravity affects objects. And they develop
            that skill not through reading about acceleration and mass, but by
            throwing things and seeing how they respond.
