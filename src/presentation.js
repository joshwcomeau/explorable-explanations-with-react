            I usually have a side project going, and earlier this year I wanted
            to try something different. Before I got into programming, I was
            an audio engineer. I've always been fascinated by how
            sound works, the physics of sound are really interesting.

            And yet, it's specialized, institutional knowledge for audio
            engineers and other folks who work with sound. It's not common
            knowledge. And I think the reason for that is that sound is a
            complex system, and it's hard to learn through traditional methods.
