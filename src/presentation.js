            So before becoming a software developer, I was studying to become
            an audio engineer. One of the things you learn, when becoming an
            audio engineer, is how sound works, the physics of sound.

            It turns out that this is surprisingly tricky, I remember we spent quite a bit of time learning about sound waves, waveforms, frequency, amplitude... sound is a complex system, and what I mean by that is that there are multiple variables, and rules about how those variables interact.

            And understanding complex systems is traditionally quite difficult.

            Something that has been said to the point of clich√© is that react
            components are like lego blocks. You can build complete UIs by
            assembling a bunch of small, simple blocks.

            A criticism I've heard of this metaphor is that it's overly
            simplistic. React components can do much more than simply render
            UI, they can generate values, or make server requests, etc.

            I think a better metaphor is...

            ...modular synthesizers. For those who aren't familiar, modular synthesizers are tools used to produce electronic sounds, like the waves we've been looking at... but a modular synthesizer is combined out of many smaller modules. Each module has inputs and outputs, so a module on its own might not produce any sound, but
            it might modulate sound that is passed through it.

            I think React components are like synth modules.

            I built this project on the side, over several months. As it
            neared completion, as happens with many side-projects, I start
            to worry that it's not useful, or good enough to release. I know
            Ives from Codesandbox has talked about this as well; when you're
            so close to a project, you lose perspective about how it'll seem
            to others, you can't see it with fresh eyes anymore.

            After releasing this project, I got a ton of really nice feedback
            like this. This wasn't an outlier. I also heard from college professors who said they'd use it, which is amazing.
